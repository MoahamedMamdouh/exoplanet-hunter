## Project Overview
The exponential growth of astrophysical data from sky survey missions like Kepler presents a significant data analysis challenge. The manual vetting of stellar transit data is a slow, labor-intensive bottleneck that limits the pace of new discoveries. This project's objective is to streamline this discovery pipeline by developing a reliable classification tool that can rapidly distinguish between genuine exoplanet candidates and false positives.

The solution is an end-to-end machine learning system consisting of a Python-based data processing pipeline, a RESTful API built with Flask to serve predictions, and a dynamic web interface for user interaction.

## Features
- **Exoplanet Classification:** Predicts if a celestial object is a `CONFIRMED` planet, `CANDIDATE`, or `FALSE POSITIVE`.
- **Model Performance Viewer:** An interactive modal displays the model's classification report and confusion matrix.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Allows users to experiment with model settings (`n_estimators`, `max_depth`) and retrain a temporary model on-the-fly to see how performance is affected.
- **Data Ingestion:** A researcher-focused feature to upload new labeled CSV data, append it to the main dataset, and trigger a full retraining of the primary model.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python, Flask, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, XGBoost
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5
- **Development:** Jupyter Lab, Git & GitHub
- **Data Source:** NASA Exoplanet Archive (Kepler Objects of Interest)
